# Advent of Code 2023 in Go (16/50 ${\color{yellow}★}$)
### Trigger Warning: bad code, terrible variable naming (nothing offensive)
Learning as I Go... ![alt text](https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/285676/1 "ha ha ha, get it?")

## Notes/thoughts on the problems:
### Day 15 (${\color{yellow}★★}$):
Part 1 wasn't too bad. Part 2 requires some thinking, which is hard. But it's enjoyable hard.<br />
Part 2 update: Minor dumb mistakes here and there lead to this taking longer than it should've. But we did it Reddit!

### Day 14 (${\color{yellow}★\color{black}★}$):
Had some time to do this one today. Part 1 was fairly easy, but part 2 is taking some time to ~~brute force~~ solve. <br />
Might have to rethink part 2.

### Day 13 (${\color{black}★★}$):
See day 12.

### Day 12 (${\color{black}★★}$):
Catching up on other stuff since the trip. Will start soonish.

### Day 11 (${\color{black}★★}$):
See day 10.

### Day 10 (${\color{black}★★}$):
Was away from the 9th to the 11th, so only just started a bit with day 9's problem. Will start this when I have more time.

### Day 9 (${\color{yellow}★★}$):
Part 1 seems fairly straightforward. I think what I have at the moment is just some dumb error in the function.<br />
Update 231215: Yep, stupid logic error. Instead of checking for sum, I should've checked if everything was 0.<br />
As soon as I figured out the way to reverse the logic, this was easy. Fun challenge.

### Day 8 (${\color{yellow}★\color{black}★}$):
Not too bad. Some logic errors on my end for part 1. <br />
Part 2 seems so straightforward, but I think I'm missing something. Will have to get back to it once my head is clearer

### Day 7 (${\color{yellow}★★}$):
Seemed like an enum problem, so I figured I'd try some of that.<br />
Took some time setting up the enums and functions, but part 1 was easy first try once that was done.<br />
Part 2, I didn't notice that 2 pairs could also be a pair of Jacks/Jokers, so not first try. *sad noises*

### Day 6 (${\color{yellow}★★}$):
Pretty easy problem overall.<br />
My number for part 2 got so huge that it ran for 20 mins, and still didn't finish, so I had to rethink my solution.

### Day 5 (${\color{black}★★}$):
My single braincell struggles to even parse the input. Will have to work on this one.

### Day 4 (${\color{yellow}★★}$):
This one was interesting. Spent some time mapping out part 2 in a spreadsheet before i tried tackling it.

### Day 3 (${\color{yellow}★★}$):
Tried doing splits and whatnot to get the numbers.<br />
Didn't finish on the actual day, and came back after doing day 4 and decided to use regex instead (since it was so easy to get the numbers that way for day 4).<br />
9/10 would regex this problem again.

### Day 2 (${\color{yellow}★★}$):
Fun puzzle, and a nice ease-in to the days ahead.

### Day 1 (${\color{yellow}★★}$):
Man, what was that part 2?<br />
The examples showed no signs of having to allow, for instance, "oneeight" to be parsed as both 1 and 8. Kinda annoyed at that.

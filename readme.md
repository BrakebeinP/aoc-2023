# Advent of Code 2023 in Go
### Trigger Warning: bad code, terrible naming (nothing offensive)
Learning as I Go... ha ha ha, get it?

## Notes/thoughts on the problems
### Day 14:
Had some time to do this one today. Part 1 was fairly easy, but part 2 is taking some time to ~~brute force~~ solve. <br />
Might have to rethink part 2.

### Day 13:
See day 12.

### Day 12:
Catching up on other stuff since the trip. Will start soonish.

### Day 11:
See day 10.

### Day 10:
Was away from the 9th to the 11th, so only just started a bit with day 9's problem. Will start this when I have more time.

### Day 9:
Part 1 seems fairly straightforward. I think what I have at the moment is just some dumb error in the function.

### Day 8:
Not too bad. Some logic errors on my end for part 1. <br />
Part 2 seems so straightforward, but I think I'm missing something. Will have to get back to it once my head is clearer

### Day 7:
Seemed like an enum problem, so I figured I'd try some of that.<br />
Took some time setting up the enums and functions, but part 1 was easy first try once that was done.<br />
Part 2, I didn't notice that 2 pairs could also be a pair of Jacks/Jokers, so not first try. *sad noises*

### Day 6:
Pretty easy problem overall.<br />
My number for part 2 got so huge that it ran for 20 mins, and still didn't finish, so I had to rethink my solution.

### Day 5:
My single braincell struggles to even parse the input. Will have to work on this one.

### Day 4:
This one was interesting. Spent some time mapping out part 2 in a spreadsheet before i tried tackling it.

### Day 3:
Tried doing splits and whatnot to get the numbers.<br />
Didn't finish on the actual day, and came back after doing day 4 and decided to use regex instead (since it was so easy to get the numbers that way for day 4).<br />
9/10 would regex this problem again.

### Day 2:
Fun puzzle, and a nice ease-in to the days ahead.

### Day 1:
Man, what was that part 2?<br />
The examples showed no signs of having to allow, for instance, "oneeight" to be parsed as both 1 and 8. Kinda annoyed at that.
